Input 1.	WAP to read the input expression and check whether input is alphabet or digits then store it as identifier. If the input is operator store it as symbol. Display identifier and symbol separately. 

Input 2.	Write a C program to test whether a given identifier is valid or not. Hint: - Read the given input string. Check the initial character of the string is numerical or any special character except ‘_’ then print it is not a valid identifier. Otherwise print it as valid identifier if remaining characters of string doesn’t contains any special characters except ‘_’.  

Input 3.	To determine whether a given word is a keyword or not (take example of four or five keyword) using finite automata state.

Input 4.	Write a C program to identify whether a given line is a comment or not.

Input 5.	Write a program to count the number of comments available in the file.


6.	WAP to determine whether a given string belongs to the Regular Expression ab*c. 

7.	WAP to determine whether a given string belongs to the Regular Expression b*c*.


Input 8.	WAP to accept all the strings, which is accepted by PDA A={anbn |n >=1}. 

Input 9.	WAP to accept all the strings, which is accepted by PDA A={wcwr | w є {a, b}}.

Input 10.	WAP to accept all the strings, which is accepted by PDA A={w є {a, b} | Number of a’s and b’s are equal}.
